# Project-Toolsuite

Project Toolsuite is a privacy-first collection of browser-based utilities designed for moments when speed, simplicity, and reliability matter most.

Whether you're working with files, development tools, graphics, security utilities, or quick productivity workflows, the goal remains the same:

Your work stays yours.

No logins. No paywalls. No "verify your email" for the 17th time.

*In development, forever... :)*

## Sitemap Generation

The sitemap is generated from the repository structure using:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_sitemap.py
```

Run this script whenever new tool pages or static pages are added to keep `sitemap.xml` up to date.

The script automatically:

- Discovers tool HTML files under `tools/`
- Includes static pages such as the homepage, privacy page, and contributors page
- Regenerates a valid `sitemap.xml`
